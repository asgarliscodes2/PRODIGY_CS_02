# Task 2 – Image Encryption using Pixel Manipulation

This Python program performs basic image encryption and decryption by modifying pixel values using a shift key. Each RGB channel is adjusted mathematically to produce an encrypted image.

## Features:
- Encrypts the image by shifting pixel values.
- Decrypts by reversing the shift.
- Uses Python pillow (PIL) library.

## Usage:
Update `input_image` with the image filename (png/jpg).
Run the script to generate encrypted and decrypted images.
